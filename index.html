                    I am currently a Ph.D. student at George Mason University in the Mathematical Sciences department.  Prior to this I was an undergraduate at the University of Virginia, class of 2024. 
                   Currently, I am working on a system of variational inequalities coupled to two heat equations with Carlos Rautenberg. At the moment (and until I can attach my name to one), my favorite theorem is Stone-Weirstrass even if I don't always force my domain to have finite measure. 
                    This site, and my github in general, our under continual construction as they serve to display the work I have completed while in my Ph.D. program.

                    Prior to going back to school to finally earn an bachelors degree, UVA class of 2024, I spent time in the luxury food and beverage industry. My specialty, and my certifications are specifically in craft beer.
                    Aside from mathematics I am continually fascinated by fermentation and the microorganisms who perpetrate it.  In fact I am interested in just about anything which could be qualified as delicious and more often then not the biological reason for the quanlifier.
                    With these in mind, your non-mathematical fun fact is: The ephemeral characteristic of terroir which wine lovers, myself included, profusely credit is actually just a consequence of the microorganisms which live on the roots of the grape vines.
                    These little fellas thrive depending on the mineral composition of the soil along temperature and moisture levels and fluctuations.
